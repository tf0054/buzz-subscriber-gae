Principles
==========

The design process for Nitro components adheres to a strict framework of principles.


Transparency
------------

A programmer needs to understand his code. We avoid Domain Specific Languages and 'magic' utilities that hide complexity.


Simplicity
----------

Simple code is (often) efficient and efficient code is beautiful. Simplicity promotes transparency. We optimize for real world applications, not 'hello world' examples.


Standards compliance
--------------------

There is no merit in reinventing the wheel. Nitro uses standard technolofies and protocols: HTTP, HTML5, XML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, JSON-Template, Atom, Microformats. Standards compliance promotes transparency (the code is easier to understand) and lowers the barrier of entry for newcomers.
