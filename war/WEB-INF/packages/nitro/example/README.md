A simple Nitro example
======================

This is a very simple example. To start the application just give:

    $ /path/to/narwhal/bin/sea
    $ jackup

Then browse localhost:8080:

    localhost:8080/
        A simple template with one interpolated param

    localhost:8080/hello
        The mandatory Hello World

    localhost:8080/stream
        A simple streaming example
	
There is not much to see in this example so go on and try the more advanced [blog-gae](http://github.com/gmosx/blog-gae) example!
